# What's New in fly

## fly 1.0.2 â€” Friendly Interactive Prompts

- Multi-match menus and prompts now write to stderr, keeping stdout clean for shell wrappers that `cd` into returned paths.
- Zsh/Bash/PowerShell wrapper docs updated to reflect the new interaction model and remove the outdated `--Multiple matches found--` sentinel check.
- Added dedicated release notes under `UpdatesDoc/fly-1.0.2.md` and refreshed the README to align with the latest installer and usage guidance.
